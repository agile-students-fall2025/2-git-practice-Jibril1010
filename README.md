# Comments:
I wanted to share another great learning resource: the YouTube channel [DaveGrayTeachesCode](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode).  

One video I found especially helpful is his **[Full Python Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2EJuAcrZYU&pp=ygUYbGVhcm4gcHl0aG9uIHByb2dyYW1taW5n)**. Itâ€™s a comprehensive walkthrough of Python fundamentals such as syntax, control flow, data types, and functions.  

### What I liked about this video:
- It starts from the basics, making it beginner-friendly.  
- The pace is balanced, not too slow but not too fast.  
- Explanations are clear and paired with practical examples.  
- It covers core topics that prepare you for more advanced Python learning.  

This tutorial is especially useful for getting ready for upcoming classes or brushing up on Python essentials.
